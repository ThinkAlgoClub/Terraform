## **1. Introduction to Terraform and Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

### **1. Concept: What is Terraform?**
Terraform is an **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tool that allows you to define and manage cloud infrastructure using a configuration file. It automates the provisioning, updating, and destruction of infrastructure resources.

---

### **2. Example: Why Use Terraform?**
Imagine you need to deploy multiple **virtual machines (VMs), databases, and networking** components in **Azure**. Instead of manually creating them in the Azure portal, Terraform allows you to define them in a configuration file and deploy everything in one command.

#### **Without Terraform (Manual Approach)**
- Log into Azure Portal
- Create a Virtual Machine
- Assign networking settings
- Configure storage and security
- Repeat for every VM

#### **With Terraform (Automated Approach)**
- Write a **Terraform configuration file**
- Run `terraform apply`
- Terraform provisions all resources automatically

---

### **3. Real-World Scenario**
A **DevOps Engineer** at a company needs to create 50 Virtual Machines (VMs) with specific configurations in **Azure**. Instead of clicking through the portal 50 times, they use **Terraform** to automate the process, reducing human errors and saving time.

### **4. Practical Steps**
Now, let's set up Terraform on your system.

#### **Step 1: Install Terraform**
Terraform is a **CLI tool**. We need to install it first.

**For Windows:**
1. Download Terraform from:  
   [https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)
2. Extract the ZIP file to a folder (e.g., `C:\terraform`)
3. Add the Terraform folder to **System PATH**:
   - Search for **"Environment Variables"**
   - Edit the **Path** variable under **System Variables**
   - Add the Terraform folder path (`C:\terraform`)
4. Open **Command Prompt (cmd)** and run:
   ```sh
   terraform -version
   ```
   Output should display the installed version.

**For Linux/Mac (Using Terminal):**
1. Run the following commands:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gnupg software-properties-common curl
   curl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
   echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install terraform
   ```
2. Verify installation:
   ```sh
   terraform -version
   ```

---

### **5. Summary**
- Terraform is an **IaC tool** that automates infrastructure deployment.
- It eliminates **manual configurations** and human errors.
- We installed Terraform on **Windows, Linux, and Mac**.
- We verified the installation using `terraform -version`.
