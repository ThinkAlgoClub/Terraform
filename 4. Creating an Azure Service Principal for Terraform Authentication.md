# **4. Creating an Azure Service Principal for Terraform Authentication**  

Terraform **should not use personal accounts** for authentication in production. Instead, we use a **Service Principal (SP)**â€”a special Azure identity with limited permissions that Terraform can use securely.

In this lesson, we will:  

âœ… Understand **what a Service Principal is** and why itâ€™s needed.  
âœ… **Create a Service Principal** using the Azure CLI.  
âœ… **Store the credentials** securely.  
âœ… **Assign the correct role** for Terraform.

## **1. Concept: What is a Service Principal?**  
A **Service Principal (SP)** is a security identity in **Azure Active Directory (AAD)** that allows applications (like Terraform) to **authenticate** and perform actions in Azure without using a personal user account.

ðŸ”¹ **Why use a Service Principal?**  
- More **secure** than using personal credentials.  
- **Least privilege principle**â€”only give the permissions Terraform needs.  
- Used for **automation**, ensuring Terraform works without manual logins.

## **2. Example: Why Do We Need a Service Principal?**  

Imagine you are an IT manager at a company. You donâ€™t want **every developer** to have full access to Azure resources. Instead, you create a **Service Principal** that only Terraform can use to manage infrastructure. This prevents accidental or malicious changes by unauthorized users.

---

## **3. Real-World Scenario**  

A DevOps engineer is setting up Terraform for a **production deployment**. Using a **Service Principal**, they ensure Terraform has the **minimum required permissions** to create and manage resources **without exposing** their personal credentials.

---

## **4. Practical Steps: Creating a Service Principal for Terraform**  

### **Step 1: Create a Service Principal**
Run the following command in the terminal:  

```sh
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "TerraformSP" --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

**Replace** `"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"` with your actual **Azure Subscription ID** (from Lesson 3).  

---

### **Step 2: Understanding the Output**  

After running the command, you will receive a JSON response with important credentials:  

```json
{
  "appId": "your-app-id",
  "displayName": "TerraformSP",
  "password": "your-client-secret",
  "tenant": "your-tenant-id"
}
```

ðŸš€ **Important! Save this information securely** because the password (**client secret**) wonâ€™t be shown again.  

---

### **Step 3: Store the Credentials Securely**  

**For Windows (Using PowerShell):**  
```powershell
$env:ARM_CLIENT_ID="your-app-id"
$env:ARM_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
$env:ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="your-subscription-id"
$env:ARM_TENANT_ID="your-tenant-id"
```

**For Linux/macOS (Using Terminal):**  
```sh
export ARM_CLIENT_ID="your-app-id"
export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="your-subscription-id"
export ARM_TENANT_ID="your-tenant-id"
```

These environment variables allow Terraform to **authenticate securely** with Azure.

---

### **Step 4: Verify the Service Principal Works**  

Run the following command to check if the Service Principal can authenticate:

```sh
az login --service-principal -u "your-app-id" -p "your-client-secret" --tenant "your-tenant-id"
```

Expected Output:
```
[
  {
    "cloudName": "AzureCloud",
    "id": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "isDefault": true,
    "name": "Azure Subscription 1",
    "state": "Enabled",
    "tenantId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "user": {
      "name": "your-app-id",
      "type": "servicePrincipal"
    }
  }
]
```

âœ… **If you see this output, your Service Principal is working correctly!**  

---

## **5. Summary**  
âœ… **Created a Service Principal (TerraformSP)**.  
âœ… **Assigned the correct role (Contributor) to the Service Principal**.  
âœ… **Stored credentials securely as environment variables**.  
âœ… **Logged in using the Service Principal** to verify authentication.
